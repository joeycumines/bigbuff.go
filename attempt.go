// LinearAttempt returns a new channel that will be published, at most, every rate, for a maximum total of count
// messages, and will be closed after either reaching count or context cancel, whichever comes first. Note that it
// is buffered and will start with a single value, and behaves identically to time.NewTicker in that it will attempt
// to keep a constant rate, but compensates for slow consumers, and in that the value received will be the time at which
// the last attempt was scheduled (the offset from the current time being equivalent to the conflation rate). Either
// rate or count being <= 0 or ctx being nil will trigger a panic. Note that the initial publish will happen inline,
// and context errors are guarded, meaning if the context returns an error when first checked then the returned channel
// will always be closed, with no values sent.
//
// This implementation is designed to be iterated over, by using range, with resource freeing via context cancel.
// It is very useful when implementing something that will attempt to perform an action at a maximum rate, for a maximum
// amount of times, e.g. for linear retry logic.
